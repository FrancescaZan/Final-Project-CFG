# Final-Project-CFG 

## Breast Cancer Prediction
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the UK. According to NHS, about 1 in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime, and early detection will significantly increase the chance of recovery.

Your client is a medical research company, and you are asked to improve the early detection of breast cancer using machine learning. The goal of the project is to train a machine learning model which predicts whether the cancer is benign or malignant.

## Logistics
You will be working in a team of 2-3 students assigned by the instructors.

- Each team nominates a project leader and makes sure to divide the tasks among the team.
- Each team is assigned with one instructor as a technical mentor, so you can ask any questions over Slack or video calls for the next 2 weeks.
- Each team has to present their work/analysis in session 12 in front of the client for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of Q&A.
- Each team has to submit their work using a Github repository.
  - The respository must include at least one Jupyter Notebook file or Python file.
  - Your work must include at least 3 visualisations.
  - The code should be clean and easy to read.
  - You are free to use any Python library.
- There will be no class on session 11, but use this session as an interim progress report to your mentor.
- The client will choose a winning team, and there will a prize for the winning team!!

## Presentation

You should give a demonstration of your analysis. Tell us the insights you found, and show a bit of the code and visualisation in your notebook, especially anything that you are particularly proud of or found particularly challenging to get working.

Presentation is free-format, but either powerpoint or Jupyter notebook presentation is common (see the "Extra Resources" section below for how to do Jupyter notebook presentation)

There will be 4 target audiences with a mix of technical and non-technical background:
 - CEO (non-technical)
 - CTO (very technical)
 - COO (slightly technical)
 - Data Scientist (very technical)

They will evaluate your work and ask questions during your presentation. They are particularly interested in the following evaluation criteria:
- Data Exploration and Processing
- Data Visualisation
- Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation
- Communication and Q&A Handling
- Creativity
